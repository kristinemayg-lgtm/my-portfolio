<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Kristine May, and I am currently studying Computer Programming at Humber College.<br><br><br>
Before deciding to return to school, I worked for nearly 11 years as a Pastry Cook in various hotels, restaurants, and pastry shops. My passion for baking started when I was young, inspired by my aunt who often baked and encouraged me to help her.<br><br><br>
Alongside baking, I have always been fascinated by computersâ€”especially building websites and working with HTML. Now that I am back in school, my goal is to strengthen my programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of the tech industry.<br><br><br>
Outside of school and work, I enjoy cooking, particularly Filipino dishes, and love preparing meals for family and friends. I also enjoy going to escape rooms, hanging out with friends, and spending time at home relaxing and cooking. Some of my current hobbies include playing badminton, pickleball, and learning tennis.<br><br><br>
I do my best to stay productive and look forward to what each new day brings. I am confident that I will complete this program successfully and continue building a strong foundation for my future.</p><br><br><br>
